If youre in San Francisco, you better do it right - by brunching with friends. If you want to do San Francisco right, check three hidden brunch venues in San Francisco:

Nopa
----
###### 560 Divisadero St, San Francisco, CA 94117

Boys - take your lady here this Saturday. Lofted ceiling and happy ambiance of the saturday brunch crowd gives a chillax vibe. The dishes here are probably one of the top tier dishes I've had in the city. Reservation is <b>highly recommended</b>. It is busy and pricy, but absolutely worth all of that. Good news is that they take reservations upto a month in advance.

Pork Store Cafe
---------------
###### 1451 Haight St, San Francisco, CA 94117

This ones for the boyz. This is definitely on the other side of the spectrum from Nopa. It's a more of a small, smell like bacon after eating and regular patron, kind of hidden gem. This venue once used to be a butcher shop, now turned into a breakfast/brunch cafe. If you had a rough Friday night and need some hangover assistance, head on over to the Pork Store Cafe.

Zazie

###### 941 Cole St, San Francisco, CA 94117

So many tourists come, and miss out on the local destinations. Zazie is one of those spots. You have to checkout their famous American style brunch.
