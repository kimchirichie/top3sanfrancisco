Sometimes you just crave some sweets. You sit there and scroll through the yelp dessert feed but can’t decide. That was me until I discovered these 3 spots.

After a year of dating my girlfriend, I’ve downed countless bobas and became repeating patron for many sweet cafes. I can’t say all of the dessert shops I’ve set my foot inside has been a sweet experience, but some of those cafes had something more special than the sweetness.

Na Ya Dessert
-------------

The perfect crunch married to the soft. If you find yourself at [Na Ya Dessert][na-ya-instagram], get yourself the [The Kaya Toasted][ka-ya-toasted]. is one of the newer menu items that can’t be beat. Combining the soft texture with crunch and sweetness, there is no going back to regular ice cream for dessert. Switch out the vanilla ice cream to chocolate for bonus.

There is a chewy that compliments the crunch very well. Bubble up and get yourself a Royal Milk Tea for some amazing crystal boba balls. These are some of the most amazing boba balls I have ever put in my mouth.

U: Dessert Story
----------------

Do it for the gram. Ladies, this place is gonna get you 100 more likes than usual. [U: Dessert Story][u-dessert-story-instagram] has some of the most instagrammable desserts in town. The drinks and dessert are beautifully presented. 

It's the dessert that drools back - The Matcha Chocolate Lava Cake. Once you cut open the beautiful cake, it will spill out the rich chocolate filling inside like a ramen egg. The Matcha Chocolate Lava Cake, the perfect balance of rich chocolate and refreshing matcha, is a must.

Ice Cream Bar
-------------

You didn’t think bars were cool, until this one. (get it?) [Ice Cream Bar][ice-cream-bar-instagram] has a retro interior, brighter than a normal bar. Be sure to grab a booze infused drink at the bar in the back of the store while you lick the ice cream cone.

I only get one flavor in this shop. Banana Puddin. It’s by far my favorite flavor. The subtle banana aroma and the opportune real chunks of banana makes this the highlight of Ice Cream Bar’s selections.
