One of the highlights of Fleet Week is an exciting performance by the <a href="https://www.blueangels.navy.mil/">U.S. Navy Blue Angels</a>. They have been performing for crowds around the world and across the United States since 1946. They are a highlight of the airshow during Fleet Week.

You’re going to want to find somewhere to sit close by the water. Anywhere along the waterfront that has a view of the Golden Gate Bridge will give you a great chance to see the Blue Angels air show each day. 

In conjunction with the air show held throughout Fleet Week, there is also the annual parade of ships. You’ll be able to watch as ships from the U.S. Navy, U.S. Coast Guard, and Royal Australian Navy, led into San Francisco Bay, under the world-famous Golden Gate Bridge by the San Francisco’s Fire Department fireboat.

This parade of ships is the largest gathering of naval ships that you’ll ever see on the West Coast and definitely worth watching. You’ll have the opportunity to go onboard and have a look at some of the mightiest naval ships in the world. 

There are also several on-shore exhibitions and events which you’ll be able to take part in as you enjoy the different air shows and naval exhibitions. If you haven’t been to the San Francisco Fleet Week event, you’re missing out on one of the best naval and military events in the world!
