Yo guys, seriously, I’ve never really enjoyed ice cream up until I moved to San Francisco. The biggest factor could have been my ice-cream-loving-gf but, it’s probably due to the dopiest ice cream venues around town. I’ve squeezed all the garbage venues out and condensed to three of my favorite ice cream shops in town.

Here we go:

Salt and Straw

There’s like this cozy feel to Salt and Straw in Hayes Valley. It’s a place where you could run into neighbors, spend time with friends, or treat yourself.

What always baffled me was the unique ice cream flavors these guys offer. Salt and Straw has monthly flavors that seriously makes you question the limits of ice cream flavors. Be sure to checkout their monthly specials, but my favorite goto is the Sea Salt w/ caramel Ribbons. It’s a serious competitor of my other favorite Banana Puddin’ from [Ice Cream Bar in Cole Valley]({% post_url 2019-11-22-best-dessert-spots-in-san-francisco %}).
The best part is that they make their own waffle cones. But if you’re feeling more like ice cream and movie, their tubs are deliverable through [postmates](https://postmates.com/). If eyes can lick things its their instagram page [@saltandstraw](https://www.instagram.com/saltandstraw/)

Smitten Ice Cream

Ever heard of the Brrr machine? So this place invented their own ice cream machine - the only one of its kind that can churn the freshest, creamiest scoop right in front of you in 90 seconds. It uses liquid nitrogen to turn delicious cream into (surprise-surprise) ice cream.

It’s definitely worth checking out for funzies, but also because even the plain vanilla taste better than normal ice cream. Apparently, everything from their ice cream bases and cone batter to sauces and cookies are made [from scratch](https://www.smittenicecream.com/about/) using only unprocessed, real, locally sourced and sustainable ingredients.

They have 5 shops throughout the Bay Area. Don’t forget they’re deliverable on [UberEats](https://www.ubereats.com/en-US/san-francisco/food-delivery/smitten-ice-cream-rockridge/CU6q9wN0Qb2kX9Zkyuf_lg/), [PostMates](https://postmates.com/), [Caviar](http://www.trycaviar.com/), and [DoorDash](https://www.doordash.com/business/21970/?utm_source=partner-link&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=21970). Check them out on Instagram [@smittenicecream](https://www.instagram.com/smittenicecream/) to stay in-the-scoop! 

Bi-Rite

###### [3692 18th St, San Francisco, CA 94110](https://goo.gl/maps/VPhWterCgDuf6c8g8)

Everytime I’m around Dolores Park I find myself at Bi-rite Ice cream. I never gave it much thought at first, but as I visited more often it grew on me. Everything that goes into the ice cream is [made in-house](https://biritemarket.com/creamery/ice-cream/) Including this beauty:

Bi-Rite Ice Cream was born out of their love for food. They make everything that goes into their ice cream, including the brownies, peanut brittle, marshmallows, and the snickerdoodles for Ricanelas. Feast your eyes on their instagram page [@biritesf](http://instagram.com/biritesf)
